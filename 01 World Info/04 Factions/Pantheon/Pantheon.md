In Ivaria the gods are not actual people or even beings. They are Ideals. Each Ideal partaining to half of a Domain. These Ideals are more like abstract ideas or "ideals" if you will. However, these "ideals" were so powerful they began to take on physical power manifesting in different ways. Each Ideal is neither good or evil. They themselves are balance. It is the men and women that wield their power that bring about the unbalance; using the force of the Ideals for either good or evil. 

These Ideals were once just that: Ideas. Before the Bonding of the Great Chord, these Ideals were just abstract ideas floating in the cosmos. Absolute truths. Then something changed. No one knows what exactly caused this awakening. Some call it Fate. Some call it God. Some call it Chance. We know it by [[The Unknown]].
