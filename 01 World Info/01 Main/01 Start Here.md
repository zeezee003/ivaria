# Basic Outline of the Campaign

There are four main overarching Arcs.
- The Pirates and the Mainland
	- This is where the party will start. There are Pirate factions terroizing the coastline of the Mainland. The Empire has done very little to stop these incursions. In fact, at times, The Kings Men can be spotted in shaddy taverns and inns. No one says anything about it however. They hold too much power. There is a Pirate Lord that over sees all the pirate factions. He has struck a deal with the Steward  and is allowed to operate within his jurisdiction. However, not all pirates are as "noble" as he is. The other faction leaders fight amounst themselves for land and gold. The Pirate Lord does nothing to stop them because at the end of the day he still gets what he wants... power. Even now he is looking for a magical item that can grant him abilites far beyond imagination. His hope is too amass enough power to overthrow the Steward. We'll see how that works out for him.
	- Token: 
		- we need them to decide to set sail 
- The Dragon and the Serpant Archipelago
	- After dealing with the pirate Lord the pirates factions are in full dissarray. The party must either estabilish themselves as the new Pirate Lords or leave it to anarchy. I suppose they could also appoint a new leader... but why...
		- Either way the treat of other pirates are still very real for the players. They are just not as organized. Smaller factions will break out. This is to just keep things interesting.
	- The tale of the Great Serpant has been known to everyone. While she was defeated long ago, her spawn still plauge the Northern Archipelago. Plot twist another serpant has emeraged. An Aboleth of an unknown name at this point. Once the Great s

I really like the Lost to Evil. Maybe he/she was one of the [[Heroes of Old]].

What does the Nemisis want?
- Lichdom?
- Maybe he's the coward steward who just wants to keep the throne. 
	- Maybe he's sold his soul to a deamon for power.. or maybe a geine.
	- I think the Steward is the main "nemesis".
- We're going to use the Lost to Evil Traitor.
	- Palps vibes.. but more messy. 
	- [[The Steward]]. He's older. 
- Now I'm thinking I like the idea of the Never-Present Nemesis.
	- This could have Assassin's Creed vibes where the PC's are up against an Organization with different ruling members. I like that Idea a lot. Maybe the Steward is still the BBEG.
		- The Steward seeks the help of the Party to rid Ivaria of this "corruption". Maybe he tries to fram the actaul King. Maybe the King is under a spell and is seen several times or at least there are rumors of the King being seen with some Cult members. 

### The Steward's Goal (BBEG)
- He want's to frame the King for being the leader of the Cult group causing the corruption in Ivaria and take the throne by default. 
	- if the king has any heirs then they also must go. So [[Jomoira Ravenheart]] and [[Theric Ravenheart]] must be dealt with. A carefully placed feud between them might work nicely. There's already been some tension between their two States that might prove to be useful. Zemo vibes. Maybe use a spell or a shifter to take the form of the King.
	- This has to come a **much** later stage in the campaign. The King is supposed to have dissapeared. So we will need reasons for the King to appear to be the leader of this group.


### Villans 
- The Pirate Lord
