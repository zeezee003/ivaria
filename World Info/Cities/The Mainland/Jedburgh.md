### Merchant's Guild

The [[Merchant’s Guild]] is made up of two buildings connected by an enclosed walkway. The main room is a long counter along the backside of the room. Tables and chairs are scattered throughout the room. There is a back room but it’s roped off. In the back is the store room. It’s where all the goods are temporarily stored before moving on. It is heavily guarded. At the counter is where the PC’s can find Privateer Contracts - These are “legal” contracts. These could include transporting cargo, passengers, taking out pirate ships etc. Really anything that would benefit the Guild. The Guild is fully sanctioned by the Elven King. This is the major way goods are shared across and outside of Ivaria.
