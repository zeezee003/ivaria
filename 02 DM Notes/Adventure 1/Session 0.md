## Backstory:

Long ago there was [[The Great Serpent]]. She was fierce, mighty and dwelt deep beneath what became to be known as Nekross. She ruled the North East with a mighty fist commanding subjugation from the surrounding provinces.

 While The Serpent reigned in the North East chaos reigned across the realm. Several sects of Pirates emerged due to Filburg's military preoccupation with The Serpent. The Elven King could not protect The Mainland and maintain the war against the Serpent. His military dwindled until he could no longer support the war in the North East. He abandoned the North East  despite the newly found Heroes’ willingness to fight the beast. The Elven King had lost all faith and hope. The Elven King retreated into his Citadel and left the rule of the realm to his confidant, The Steward.

 Four Heroes emerged to fell the beast. They fought with such bravery and such nobility that has yet to be seen since. Yet this did not come without a cost. Each of the Old Heroes died saving the realm from this Evil. 

 The aftermath of this time was severe.The Pirates remained at large and the realm fell into ruin. The kingdom was shattered. The realm was divided into three provinces: The Mainland, The Serpent Archipelago, and The Green Crescent. 

 In the following years the tale of the Heroes became that of Legend, and eventually, Myth. It has been decades since the people have seen the Elven King.

 When the oversight of the realm was handed to The Steward the children of the Elven King left the capitol and took up residence among the people. The Son (Theric Ravenheart) in the fishing town of Porthcawl, and the Daughter (Jomoira Ravenheart) in the barracks of Farfast. They came to rule their own local province despite The Steward. Theric rules what is now known as Merkos, and Jomoira rules what is known as Blüdmoon.

 The Mainland fell to the rule of the Pirates and there is a continual war with the pirate factions.

 The Serpent Archipelago, while rid of The Great Serpent, is still riddled with lesser serpents that plague the local fishermen.

 The Green Crescent is the only peaceful place in all the realm. It is still under the rule of the Elven King and his Navy. However, his forces are stretched thin and the outer ramparts are weakening. 

Merkos envelopes Lingmell, Porthcawl, Queenstown and Kingstown

Blüdmoon envelopes Farfast, Aston, Lullin and Lessa

The Steward really only oversees the Capital of Filnburg, The Outpost of Brisbun, and the old Naval Port of Enstin

 The Heroes of Old (lvl 20):

Male Elf: Trajeon Willowfate - Ranger

Female Human: Zave Ashtrength - Barbarian

Male Dwarf: Balbek Hammerhorn - Wizard

Male Halfling: Condal Hilleyes - Cleric

 Notes on the Realm:

The main export of the realm is fish and lumber. Each town and city is a port city. Much of The Mainland is untamed and wild. Venturing far too inland can prove to be treacherous. The local fishermen of The Mainland are riddled with warring factions of pirates. It is best to be careful in those parts. The Serpent Archipelago is not much safer with the lesser sea creatures roaming the waters. The Green Crescent is fruitful and bountiful under the rule of The Steward. Yet the plight of the North and The Mainland grow ever increasingly in the ears of the locals and there is unrest. What happens is yet to be seen. 

 The realm is made up of Elves, Dwarfs, Men, Halfings, and everything in between. The Green Crescent is mostly made up of Elves while the Dwarves are mostly found in Holbeck to the North of The Mainland. The Serpent Archipelago is mostly made up of Men and Half Elves. Halflings can mostly be found on The Mainland and the surrounding islands.
