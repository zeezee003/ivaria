# A Breif History:

Long ago there was [[The Great Serpent]]. She was fierce, mighty and dwelt deep beneath what became to be known as the Place Ye Shall Not Go ([[Nekross]]). She ruled the North East with a mighty fist commanding subjugation from the surrounding provinces.
  
While the Serpent reigned in the North East chaos reigned across the realm. Several sects of Pirates emerged due to [[Filnburg]]'s military preoccupation with the Serpent. [[The Elven King]] could not protect [[The Mainland]] and maintain the war against the Serpent. His military dwindled until he could no longer support the war in the North. He abandoned the North despite the newly found Heroes’ willingness to fight the beast. [[The Elven King]] had lost all faith and hope. [[The Elven King]] retreated into his Citadel and left the rule of the realm to his confidant, The Hand of The King.  

Four [[Heroes of Old]] emerged to fell the beast. They fought with such bravery and such nobility that has yet to be seen since. Yet this did not come without a cost. Each of the Old Heroes died saving the realm from this Evil. 

The aftermath of this time was severe. The Pirates remained at large and the realm fell into ruin. The kingdom was shattered. The realm was divided into three provinces: [[The Mainland]], [[The Serpent Archipelago]], and [[The Green Crescent]]. 

In the following years the tales of the [[Heroes of Old]] became that of Legend, and eventually, Myth. It has been decades since the people have seen [[The Elven King]].

[[The Mainland ]]fell to the rule of the Pirates and there is a continual war with the pirate factions.  

[[The Serpent Archipelago]], while rid of [[The Great Serpent]], is still riddled with lesser serpents that plague the local fishermen.  

[[The Green Crescent]] is the only peaceful place in all the realm. It is still under the rule of the Elven King and his Navy. However, his forces are stretched thin and the outer ramparts are weakening. 

The [[Heroes of Old]]:

Male Elf: [[Trajeon Willowfate ]]
Female Human: [[Zave Ashtrength]]
Male Dwarf: [[Balbek Hammerhorn ]]
Male Halfling: [[Condal Hilleyes ]]

### Notes on the Realm:

The main export of the realm is fish and lumber. Each town and city is a port city. Much of [[The Mainland]] is untamed and wild. Venturing far too inland can prove to be treacherous. The local fishermen of the mainland are riddled with warring factions of pirates. It is best to be careful in those parts. [[The Serpent Archipelago]] is not much safer with the lesser sea creatures roaming the waters. [[The Green Crescent]] is fruitful and bountiful under the rule of The Steward. Yet the plight of the North and [[The Mainland]] grow ever increasingly in the ears of the locals and there is unrest. What happens is yet to be seen. 

The realm is made up of Elves, Dwarfs, Men, Halfings, and everything in between. [[The Green Crescent]] is mostly made up of Elves while the Dwarves are mostly found in [[Holbeck]] to the North of the Mainland. [[The Serpent Archipelago]] is mostly made up of Men and Halfelves. Halflings can mostly be found on [[The Mainland]] and the surrounding islands.  

  
  

#### NOTES WITH THE LEWIS MEN:

The King has a Son and a Daughter who hate each other, Cold War Style. One son is on Porthcawl and the Daughter is on Farfast.

People in the Arpeligallo are called the [[Norn]]. Akin to mudblood 

[[Enstin]] is Pearl Harbor

[[Brisbun]] is Osgiliath 

Brother ([[Theric Ravenheart]]) - Politician Fighter “Province” named [[Merkos]]

Sister ([[Jomoira Ravenheart]]) - Nazi Barbarian “Province” named [[Blüdmoon]]  

[[The Duldrum]]/The Abyss - The wind can come to a stand still

The serpent creates are called the [[Kross]] 

[[Vork]] is prosperous due to good serpents 

[[Stawford]] - Port Royal

[[Firebend]] - Tortuga
 
The reef near [[Firebend]] is the Coals. Maybe give a +2 to morale instead of +1 for hot tubs!

The Great Barrier Reef - [[Petros]]

[[The King’s Men]] look just like the Brits from Pirates of the Caribbean. # RedCoats  - Captains/Officers look like Commodore Norington.

I want gold (gp) to play a large factor in this campaign. They can raid, pillage and plunger for gold or work contracts. 7

Different logos for each Sibling Province
