Opening Scene

  
It’s damp..and cold. You feel your chest throbbing with every labored breath you take. You feel a rocking and an uneasiness in your stomach. You come too and your vision is not quite all there. You can make out shapes of what appears to be of men. Shadows on the wall, flickering in the dim light. You reach out to them for help only to find your arms reach no farther than the iron bars keeping you at bay. You then realize your hands and legs are bound in iron, and these men are nothing more than brutal pirates. 

What do you do?
-   All PCs start in the cargo hold of the Galley, chained at the hands and feet.

-   There are three Pirates guarding the PCs in the brig. Hobbes ‘No Knees’ Rivers, Colden ‘One-Eared’ Bristol, and Dagwood ‘The One-Tooth’ Tempest.
    
-   There are some barrels nearby, presumably filled with rum and gunpowder. 
    
-   In the cargo hold (where the PCs are) there is a nail that they can use to pick the lock on their chains and the cargo door. They can only see this on a successful DC 15 perception check. The nail cannot be used in combat. It functions as a lockpicking device. This will break when they open the door, regardless of how many of them are unchained. 
    
-   Three lanterns dimly light the brig.
    
-   This ship is a Galley
    
-   The PCs have a few options. Talk with the Pirates and convince one of them to let them out, sleight of hand the key off Dagwood, or wait for help. Dagwood is the farthest one away from the PCs.
    
-   The ship is between Jedburgh, Stawford and Mirefield. Presumably to sell them as slaves at Jedburgh. 
    
Encounter 1 
-   If they decide to wait they will encounter a mutiny. The PCs suddenly hear commotion topdeck. DC 10 Perception/Investigation to know what’s happening. They are given short swords for the encounter unless they somehow get to their weapons in the captain's cabin. 
    
-   NPC name (John - Paladin 7 lvl) runs to the lower deck and finds the PCs. He either kills the guards and frees them or finds them freed already.
    
-   John comes from Bromwich. His goal was to take back his fathers ship (Black Wind) from these dreaded pirates. This scene is years in the making for him. This is the end of John’s adventure. John’s father was a fisherman and used Black Wind as his ship. His ship was overtaken by Pirates near Mirefield (he should have known not to get too close to that wretched city) where his father Odrem was killed and the ship was lost. John’s sole mission was to avenge his father and take back what is rightfully his: Black Wind.
    
-   There is a way they can get back their weapons. I imagine they would be located in the captain's cabin as they are really beautiful weapons. 
    
-    He does offer to drop off the PCs at Jedburgh when they make port. 
    
The PCs had decided to do something different. The goal is to get them back to Strawford.

-   They are about to board a pirate ship. 
    


Jedburg

  

The city is a common fishing town. It’s raining. As you come ashore you instantly smell the skank of fish. You see beggars with outstretched hands. As you walk off the dock you begin to see run down buildings and really get a sense that this place…  

  

-   There is a blacksmith where they can get any simple weapon for gold. This might be useful if they failed to get their original gear back. 
    



  

Graveyard

  

-   Someone or something is digging up the graves at the cemetery on the hill. 
    

  

-   DC 10 perception check at the graves they hear a twig snap nearby like someone or something is nearby.
    

  

-   NPC named Michael. Nervous type and very sus. Not the culprit. He lives in town and has a really creepy thing for the barmaid. Gives bogus reasons for everything. Can’t trust him. 40 years old Human. Looks gross. A cross between Mr. Collins (BBC) and Mr. Filch but younger.
    

  

-   Graves look like they were dug with a shovel not claws. 
    

  

-   There are claw marks on the 
    

  

-   Necklace nearby one of the tombstones. Heart locket. Cannot be open. Could be magical. This locket was dropped by one of the pirates. Old family heirloom. Davy Jones style locket. He’s pretty pissed at losing it and will come after whoever has it. It’s a seeing locket. Allowing the pirate captain to listen in on the PCs convos. 
    

  

-   7/20 graves dug up. Bodies still there with the caskets open. Totally desecrated. The thieves we’re looking for a very specific thing. There’s no pattern to the faces that were dug. They seem at random. 
    

  

Encounter 2

-   After talking to Micahel they hear another twig snap and a scout party jumps them in the graveyard.
    

  

-   The cleric at the temple would know what kind of magic the locket contains. Dark evil magic. 
    

  

-   The merchants guild would know where the locket came from or where it was made.
    

  

Cliffside Caves

As you approach the cliffs you feel the crisp salt air against your face. [Add more here]

-   This is a dungeon of 7 rooms
    
-   It’s a sprawling cave system that has lots of dead ends.
    

  
  

Pirate Cove

  

-   The PCs are led to a pirate cove or sorts (WHY??). Part Island of the dead part skull island from Peter Pan. It’s a small island in The Coals. They can charter a ship from John or from a local sea captain at the merchants guild. But that will have to be for the right price. John would be a better choice, since he’s already semi invested in the players. He can be a contact. 
    

  

-   I also imagine that they have a ship of some sorts since they are an established crew. They could also work towards finding it again. 
    

  

-   Find information needed for a special purpose
    

  

-   Seize control of a fortified location such as a fortress, town, or ship.
    

  

-   In a cliff face / In sea caves
