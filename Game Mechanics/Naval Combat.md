Command Structure - Decide before!

#### Initiave
Roll initiave for all each member of the party and one roll for the crew. The ship will share initivae with the Captian and act right after them. The crew's vitatlity may affect the ships initivate?

### Orders Stage
The Captian and Officers will issue orders based on their abilites on their officer sheets. This is the buff/debuff stage.

### Movement
This is where the ship takes it's movement at the joint agreement of **all** the officers. The PC's may also move durning this stage of the encounter. They may not move outisde the movement stage. If they do they will do so with disadvantage and may result in falling prone and/or loosing their issued order (see [[Naval Combat#Orders Stage]]). Some of the officers abilites require them to be within range of a friendly unit. This is the time to move into position.

### Combat
This is where the party usess their attack abilites if they have them. If they have issued an order, the party member cannot attack. However, the weapon rolls for the ship are done by the party according to their orders.

### Battleshock
This is where we determine the moral of the crew after each round. (A round finishing after each faction has taken one full turn).

### End Combat
Repeat this starting at the Orders Stage and continue to play until either one faction's ship is elimitated, surrendered, or the opposing officers are killed.

### Ship-to-Ship Combat
If one of the ships manages to board the other then combat plays out per normal D&D 5E rules. New initiaves are rolled for each officer. For the pusposes of hand-to-hand combat we ignore the crew and assume they are fighting in the background. At the end of combat we will roll for battleshock and see how much of the crew remains.
